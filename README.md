/* MY FIRST WEB PAGE!!!! */

This project is meant to reinforce the skills I just learned through my initial tutorials for HTML and CSS. For this project, I will use a functioning webpage as a template to build my first webpage using the developer tools for Google Chrome.

What I hope to gain from this is a better familiarity with web dev proecesses and to increase my proficiency with coding.
